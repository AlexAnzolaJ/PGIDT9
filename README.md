### Guidance Questions for Potential Interviews:

Have you been in a  complicated situation (like dealing with an insurance company, or a business dispute) where you wished someone had helped you out or given you some guidance? Tell me more about that. Were you able to get help? How? From whom?

Who have you asked or would you ask for help in such situations? Why?

What level of engagement and commitment do you expect from the person helping you?

How would you choose between different options? Is there anything specific you look for?

If you have received such help in the past:
- What exactly was the issue you needed help with?
- Briefly describe what you liked the most about the experience
- Briefly describe anything that you think could have been done better.
- Do you think the help you received was appropriate and effective?
- Would you care sharing with us the outcome of the process.
- Would you ask the same person again for help or would you recommend that person to others? Why?

Can you tell me about other situations where you struggled?

If there was a comprehensive service that provides you with assistance for a small fee, would you use it? Why?

Would you trust a person that you don't know directly to help you out?

What would help you establish a relationship and trust such a person?

What are you looking for if you need someone to advocate for you in your behalf?

Would you feel better if such a person is backed by a strong organization/government institution? Why?

In which areas would you most likely seek help:
- [] Dealing with medical professionals (doctors, pharmacist, caretakers) to better understand issues and communicate more effectively
- [] Dealing with Social Services and other government institutions
- [] Filing forms and documents, e.g. insurance claims, registration/cancellation of services, etc
- [] Dealing with technical issues, like setting up a WiFi connection or finding the right contractor for a repair job
- [] Dealing with business disputes, e.g. negotiating an extension for payment or enquire about errors in a bill/invoice
- [] Dealing with and representing you in minor legal issues - Note: this is not the same as providing professional legal advice.
- [] Physical help with minor tasks
- [] Others:_______________________

Note: Under no circumstances would the person/service providing assistance to you have access you your private information, such as banking details, etc.
